## How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## 1. Introduction
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company located in Chicago. Cyclistic offers a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations througout the state. It also offers reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to make bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes, and about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. 

### 1.1. Case Background
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno (the director of marketing) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

### 1.2. The Goal and Business Tasks
Moreno as the director of marketing has set a clear goal to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. But first, the marketing analyst team need to analyze these following questions:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The analysis will be done by using [Cyclistic historical bike trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to identify trends.

### 1.3. The Stakeholders
1. Lily Moreno: The director of marketing. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
